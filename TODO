add several glass ball with different density
fix size with different width and height
support complicated obj file
support texture map in mesh

speed up for path tracing:
1. huge amount of sampling is only necessary for diffuse surface
2. metropolis light transport

change the use of drand48()  would probably make path tracing faster
